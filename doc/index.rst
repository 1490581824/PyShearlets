Welcome to PyShearlets's documentation!
====================================

`PyShearlets` is a package for performing the fast finite shearlet transform
(FFST).

Both forward and inverse 2D transforms are implemented.

This package is a port of the FFST Matlab toolbox.  The original Matlab
implementation is copyright 2014 Sören Häuser and is covered by a GPL v3
license. See the `original readme <readme_orig_>`_ and COPYING_ for the license
terms).

The original Matlab implementation (v0.2) can be obtained `matlab toolbox <matlab_toolbox_>`_

The implementation is described in the following publications.

S. Häuser, G. Steidl (2014). `Fast Finite Shearlet Transform: a tutorial. ArXiv. (1202.1773) <ref1_>`_,

S. Häuser and G. Steidl (2013). Convex Multiclass Segmentation with Shearlet Regularization. International Journal of Computer Mathematics. 90, (1), 62-81.

For more information, please refer to the readme_ in the Github repository.
